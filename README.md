# Chaos-Theory---Random-Particle
Using Chaos Theory and Randomness to create a Fractal. Yes A Fractal, just using a ludo dice and some set of rules!!!

The project depicts a 3 point ABC fashioned as a triangle and one random point. We set some rules and see the behaviour of the particles.

when the dice shows a 1 or a 2
  - we take point A as reference and from the random point go halfway to point A and mark it. this point is then used as random point for future reference.
  
similarly when the dice shows a 3 or 4 
   - we take point B as reference and from the random point go halfway to point B and mark it. this point is then used as random point for future reference.
   
 and finally when the dice shows 5 or 6
   - we take point C as reference and from the random point go hafway to point C and mark it. this point is then used as random point for future reference.
   
We continue the above process for n iterations and see a pattern.

This pattern or shape is called as 'Sierpinski Gasket/Triangle'.
This project uses just 3 points A,B,C for a simple demonstration. Any number of points can be used for the demonstration. 

This shows how a simple set of rules and randomness can lead to fractal patterns.

Javascript and HTML Canvas is used for this project.
Will look forward to add user interactivity and more in-depth details.
